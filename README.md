# EasyNotes

Cross-platform Flutter client (iOS, Android, and Windows) for EasyNotes (name preliminary!), an End-to-End-Encrypted note taking app with (to me) just the right level of abstraction: Notes in Topics infinitely nestable Subtopics - kind of like files and folders in your filesystem.

The Backend is in another (currently private) repo, and will be linked here shortly.

## Milestones

    [x] UI: Login, Main Screen, Drag & Drop of Notes and Topics
    [x] End-to-End Encryption
    [ ] Keyboard Shortcuts
    [ ] Self-hostable
